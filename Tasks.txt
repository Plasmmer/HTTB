- use mlq to display error messages at signup and login pages

- signup: email before username
- login: accept both email and username

- signup: Web 2.0 and Web3 tabs; in Web3 tab, form also have ETH address
- login: Web 2.0 and Web3 tabs; in Web3 tab, form accepts only ETH address instead of email/username

- signup: add its entry adding +1 to ID in users.json. Git commit on every new signup. Message: -m "Register new Web 2.0 user" -m "Username: $Username" -m "ID: $ID"

- turn custom/db into a git repo. avoid install.sh overwritting db

- redirect /login.html to /login

- if user is already logged, redirect /login to the logged start page

- fix custom/handle_requested_resource.sh

- MOVED TO: https://github.com/Plasmmer/HTTB/issues/4

- Support for any kind of file, which will include .svg

- Support for HTTPS and Certbot plugin (test in Web3Framework)

- test compiling to c with "shc -f httb" and from the C source, to RustðŸ”¥

- use mlq to display custom error messages in login-error.html and signup-error.html (not writing directly to these files, but pre-rendering)

httb's JSON DB at Floflis Profile site can handle somewhat like 1K simultaneous usr or some more; but before getting closer to limit, httb should abstract its own ways to handle full MySQL databases

- support for download.json

future feature: enter folders listing their files, using Screens Explorer (this will be linked with Screens Explorer's own task through Github). Save the comics.html page and bash functions as example

support for DML

if browser doesn't support DML, parse/convert and send HTML. (this will mean more server resources used)
